      <h3>Africa is the most multilingual continent in the world</h3>

      <div id="languages-facts">
        <div>
          There are more than 2000 recognised languages in Africa with at least 3000 ethnic groups
          with each of them having different dialects.  Different groups of people moved around and traded with each other, which helped
          create new langauges and dialects
        </div>
        <div>
          One of the reasons Africa is the most 
          multilingual continent is the world is because people in Africa have lived there for a very 
          long time, over 7 million years, and have had more time to develop languaged that people elsewhere 
          in the world.

      <h3>Nigeria has the highest number of twins born in the world</h3>
      <p>Nigeria is a large African country that has gained a reputation as "The Land of Twins," 
        thanks to its unusually high rate of twin births. According to the BBC, West Africa has 
        four times more twin births than any other region in the world, and the town of Igbo-Ora 
        in Nigeria is particularly well-known for its high number of twins. Recent statistics suggest
