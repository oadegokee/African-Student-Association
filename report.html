        <h2>How we believe we have met the expectations:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We have a real client being the club African Student Assc.</li>
            <li>Each webpage has the same header throughout.</li>
            <li>There was 10 original pages that was planned out. I believe 9/10 of those pages were created, 1 missing due to contribution issues.</li>
            <li>Within our header, we have about half of our webpages linked.</li>
            <li>Every page is responsive for smaller screens. Our nav bar turns into a hamburger menu when small enough.</li>
            <li>Our global style makes sure the header and footer is the same throughout all pages. We have a neutral color scheme going on through out the entire website, and each page contains their own stylesheet.</li>
            <li>Every image in the finished pages should contain an 'alt' attribute.</li>
            <li>Favicon???</li>
            <li>Every image in each page is held within the images folder.</li>
            <li>No libraries and frameworks are used within the website.</li>
            <li>Each page has been validated by W3C, if there were errors before there are no more now.</li>
            <li>The assignment will be shared through a .zip file on Canvas.</li>
            <li>All files are lowercase and contain only letters.</li>
            <li>All content is neatly organized within each file.</li>
            <li>Font???</li>
            <li>There are links to externals sites like social media all throughout the site. In the footer there is links to Facebook and Instagram. On the E-board page, each member as links to their own social media like Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter.</li>
            <li>All source code is legible and easy to read.</li>
            <li>The navbar is consistent throughout the entire website site because of your global.css stylings shared in each file.</li>
            <li>Each webpage has the same header and footer.</li>
            <li>There's grids and flexboxes implemented in almost every, if not every, page on the site.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h2>Critique from client</h2>
        <p>I like how the main page has an image from an actual ASA event. I wish the webpage design was more colorful or incorporated more of African designs to tie in the theme. I like how the site has everything that a person would need to learn more about this club. It'd be nice if the website could stay continuosly updated for the future years.</p>
