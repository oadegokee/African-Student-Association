        <h2>How we believe we have met the expectations:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Client: </b>We have a real client being the African Student Asscociation organization on campus</li>
            <li><b>Header: </b>Each webpage has the same header throughout using a global stylesheet</li>
            <li><b>Pages: </b>There was 10 original pages that was planned out. I believe 9/10 of those pages were created, 1 missing due to contribution issues.</li>
            <li><b>Nav: </b>Included navigation links as part of the headers on each webpage.</li>
            <li><b>Responsive: </b>Used media queries to implement seperate layouts for large screens and small screens. Our nav bar turns into a hamburger menu when small enough.</li>
            <li><b>Global Style Sheet: </b>Our global style makes sure the header and footer is the same throughout all pages. We have a neutral color scheme going on through out the entire website, and each page contains their own stylesheet.</li>
            <li><b>Alt Attribute: </b>Every image has an alt attribute that describes the image content</li>
            <li><b>Favicon: </b></li>
            <li><b>Non-HTML Resources: </b>Every image in each page is held within the images folder. Created a CSS folder to store all CSS files.</li>
            <li><b>Third-Party Libraries or Frameworks: </b>No libraries and frameworks are used within the website.</li>
            <li><b>W3C Validator: </b>Each page has been validated by W3C, if there were errors before there are no more now.</li>
            <li><b>Sharing Project: </b>The assignment will be shared through a .zip file on Canvas.</li>
            <li><b>Naming Convention: </b>All files are lowercase and contain only letters.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment: </b>All content is neatly organized within each file.</li>
            <li><b>Font Faces: </b>Used two different font faces across the webpage. Headings and footer have a different front from the other content on the page</li>
            <li><b>External Links: </b>There are links to externals sites like social media all throughout the site. In the footer there is links to Facebook and Instagram. On the E-board page, each member as links to their own social media like Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. Clicking on these links opens a new tab instead of replacing the current page.</li>
            <li><b>Source Code: </b>All source code is legible and easy to read. Used meaningful names for classes and IDs</li>
            <li><b>Nav Bar: </b>The navbar is consistent throughout the entire website site because of the global.css stylings shared in each file.</li>
            <li><b>Header and Footer: </b>Each webpage has the same header and footer.</li>
            <li><b>Flexboxes/Grids: </b>There's grids and flexboxes implemented in almost every, if not every, page on the site.</li>

        <h2>Critique from client</h2>
				<p>
					I appreciate the way the photo and quotes on the home page captures the essence of ASA. The fun facts page
					adds an engaging element to the website. However, it would be great if the fun facts page could be more interactive,
					maybe adding a "guessing" game or other interactive features. It would also be helpful if the events page had a calender
					view to provide a clear overview of upcoming events.
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of design, it would be nice to incoporate more vibrant colors or African-inspired designs to tie in with the theme.
					I like that the website provides enough information about ASA and its various aspects. It would be great if the website could be
					regularly updated to ensure it remains relevant and current for future years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall I appreciate all of the time and effort put into creating this website but there are opportunities for improvement in terms
					of interactiviy, design and updates.
